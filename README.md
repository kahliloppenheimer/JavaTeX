This repo contains a java program that will take in an input CSV file, and a given LaTeX template file, and generate individual LaTeX pages (reports) for each data item in the CSV file, with special escape sequences to refer to the next piece of data in the CSV file, or the corresponding header item. For example.

Usage:
java JavaTeX [input_csv_file] [output_tex_file] [input_LaTeX_template]
